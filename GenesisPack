Basic idea:
- Expand upon already existing Vanilla features, or make them more interesting. (VERY ORIGINAL I KNOW)

Some materials have already been given a couple uses:
- Copper is more involved in redstone, taming and decoration with Copper Cogs, Wrenches, Lanterns and Collar Tags.
- Amethyst is more focused towards decoration.
- Galosphere Silver is added into Backpack and Crude Cladding recipes.
- Echo Shards can give the player more respawns in Hardcore mode.

Pillagers expanded with Savage and Ravage.
More biomes are added with Biomes o' Plenty and Infernal Expansion, Nullscape and Gardens of the Dead.
The End has been made more challenging to traverse with Nullscape.
New Shields, now you can parry your attacks thanks to Shield Expansion.
Ancient Cities have been given a makeover with Abundant Atmospheres.
New Cave biomes thanks to Galosphere, Biomes o' Plenty (and biome makeover to some extent).
Easier Item filtering with the Golden Hopper.
More farming oppourtunities with Farmer's Delight.
Mob Vote mobs from 2020, 2021 and 2022 have made their way into the pack.
Dungeons, Mineshafts and Strongholds have been improved thanks to YUNG's Better Dungeons, Better Mineshafts and Better Strongholds.
The Inventory is muuch better thanks to Inventorio.
The Stamina bar exists! With stamina you can dodge, the more armor you have the less you can dodge (highlighted by the steel feathers), you can
mitigate this effect by having the lightweight enchantment applies.

Misc. changes and additions:
- Mending has been replaced with Preservation, an enchantment that lets you repair your tools without the worry of extra exp usage or too expensive debuff.
  Just put Preservation when your absolutely sure your tool is maxed out, you can't add more enchants after putting preservation on.

- Villagers now sell Baby Animals.
- XP Tome to store your experience.

- Labels for easier organization.
- Certain food can give certain effects.
- You can now slap an Ender Chest on your horse.
- You can reroll your enchantments and the items stay in after closing.
