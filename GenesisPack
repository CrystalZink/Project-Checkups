Basic idea:
- Expand upon already existing Vanilla features, or make them more interesting. (VERY ORIGINAL I KNOW)

Some materials have already been given a couple uses:
- Copper is more involved in redstone, taming and decoration with Copper Cogs, Wrenches, Lanterns and Collar Tags.
- Amethyst is more focused towards decoration.
- Galosphere Silver is added into Backpack and Crude Cladding recipes.
- Echo Shards can give the player more respawns in Hardcore mode.

Undead Monsters have been expanded with Rotten Creatures.
Pillagers expanded with Savage and Ravage.
More biomes are added with Biomes o' Plenty and Infernal Expansion.
The End has been made more challenging to traverse with Nullscape.

Mob Vote mobs from 2020, 2021 and 2022 have made their way into the pack.
Dungeons, Mineshafts and Strongholds have been improved thanks to YUNG's Better Dungeons, Better Mineshafts and Better Strongholds.
The Inventory is muuch better thanks to Inventorio.
