Basic concepts for a potential Ultra Hardcore Modpack:

Foundation mods would consist of:
- Majrusz's Progressive Difficulty
- Enemy Expansion
- Alex Mobs
- Tough as Nails
- Champions (Configured to not drop any unique loot besides ExP)
- BYG (To piss off sprite artists)

- Basic Description:
Basically a Expert/Master mode for Minecraft, things are made to be more challenging/tedious/annoying to manage as possible while still trying to be fun in some regard.
Golden Apples have their recipes changed to require 4 Gold blocks and 4 Ingots instead of 8 Ingots.
Mobs are waaaay more intelligent.
The game is automatically stuck on Hardcore mode with no natural health regen.
