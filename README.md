If your here you probably either randomly stumbled onto this or I redirected you here, cool do whatever ya want its not like imma mind lul.
This mainly exists to make my life easier so i dont have to slap my changelogs for my Texture Packs or any other project on a private discord,
it's much easier to do so in a random GitHub repo.

I make Minecraft Texture packs, if you couldn't already tell by the previous sentence, my style is fairly close to how Vanilla does its art.
There really isn't much to say if imma keep it real here, just made my life a smidge easier :P
